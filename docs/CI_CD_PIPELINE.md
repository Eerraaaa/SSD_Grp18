# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline is built using GitHub Actions and provides comprehensive automation for building, testing, securing, and deploying the ElectraEdge e-commerce platform.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Security Scan üîí
- **SAST Scanning**: Uses Semgrep to detect security vulnerabilities in code
- **Dependency Audit**: Scans npm and Composer dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Container Security**: Uses Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- **OWASP Top 10**: Checks against common web application security risks

### 2. Code Quality & Linting üõ†Ô∏è
- **JavaScript Linting**: ESLint with security-focused rules
- **PHP Syntax Check**: Validates PHP code syntax
- **Code Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code style
- **HTML/CSS Validation**: Basic structure validation

### 3. Testing üß™
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for JavaScript testing
- **Database Connectivity**: Tests MySQL connection
- **Docker Build**: Validates Docker image creation
- **Docker Compose**: Tests container orchestration

### 4. Performance Testing ‚ö°
- **Lighthouse CI**: Web performance, accessibility, and SEO testing
- **Load Testing**: Basic Apache Bench load testing
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals monitoring

### 5. Performance Testing ‚ö°
- **Lighthouse CI**: Web performance, accessibility, and SEO testing
- **Load Testing**: Basic Apache Bench load testing
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals monitoring

## Trigger Conditions

- **Push to main/develop**: Triggers full pipeline
- **Pull Requests**: Runs security, lint, and test jobs
- **Manual Trigger**: Available for all jobs

## Pipeline Focus

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Code quality and consistency checks

## Security Features

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Semgrep integration
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Custom security rules

### Dependency Management
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Weekly dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security patch automation

### Container Security
- Trivy vulnerability scanning
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Non-root user execution

## Performance Monitoring

### Core Web Vitals
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 2s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- Total Blocking Time (TBT) < 300ms

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support

## Local Development

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run pre-commit checks
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run test
```

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run test          # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
npm run lint          # Run all linting
npm run format        # Format code
npm run security:audit # Security audit
npm run performance   # Performance testing
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Security Scan Failures**
   - Check Semgrep results in Security tab
   - Review dependency audit reports
   - Update vulnerable dependencies

2. **Test Failures**
   - Check Jest test output
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Review test coverage reports

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Review Lighthouse CI reports
   - Check Core Web Vitals metrics
   - Optimize images and assets

### Getting Help

- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Review Security tab for vulnerability details
- Contact DevOps team for deployment issues

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
